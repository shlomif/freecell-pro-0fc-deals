The board is:

```
Foundations: H-A C-3 D-3 S-4
Freecells:
: 2H 5C JD 4D KH KD KS QH JC TD 9S 8D
: 4H
: 7C 6D 5S
: 7D 6C 5H 4C 3H
: TS 9H 8S
: QC JH TC 9D 8C 7H 6S 5D
: QS
: KC QD JS TH 9C 8H 7S 6H

```

This spawns 1949697 derived positions, with some cards moved to the foundations
but KS always stays on KD.

Is there a way to prune such dead ends? Note that it **MUST NOT** declare a
state as a dead end when it is in fact winnable.
