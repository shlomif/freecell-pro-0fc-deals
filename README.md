# freecell-pro-0fc-deals

Finding zero freecells deals in the fc-pro range. The interesting file is
`0fc-log.txt`. "S" there means the following deal is solvable. "Int" means
it is intractable and the solver ran out of resources before determining
its solvability. If a deal does not appear in the list and is below the latest
one, then it is impossible.
